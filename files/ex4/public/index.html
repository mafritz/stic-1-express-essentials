<h1>Static page served without a route</h1>
<p>This page is served as a static page. The page is associated with a CSS file and contains an image, which are also served as static files.</p>
<div class="image-frame">
    <img src="images/tecfa-affiche.png">
</div>
<p>All static files in the folder are accessible through the URL relative to the static folder, in this case we link to an <a href="about.html">About</a> page.</p>
<p>But you can also mixin with dynamic route, like this one: <a href="contacts.html">Contacts</a></p>
